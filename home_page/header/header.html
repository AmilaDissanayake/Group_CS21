        <pre>Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from philosophy, religion,
            


            
            and arts to science, politics, and sports. Others function as more personal online diaries or online 




            brand advertising of a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text, digital images, 




            and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. The ability of readers to 




            leave publicly viewable comments, and interact with other commenters, is an important contribution to
            


            
            the popularity of many blogs. However, blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online comments




            to remove hate speech or other offensive content. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some
            


            
            focus on art (art blogs), photographs (photoblogs), videos (video blogs or "vlogs"), music (MP3 blogs),




            and audio (podcasts). In education, blogs can be used as instructional resources; these are referred to




            as edublogs. 




            Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts.</pre>
